Project Goals
=============

Boss Shadow is a project combining cloud compute, splunk enterprise, and ansible automation to deploy out a working Splunk Boss of the SOC CTF competition.

Our minimum viable product (mvp) will initialize a secure AWS environment, install Splunk on one or more Linux EC2 instances, install BOTS components and data, and finally distribute login credentials to players and teams.

Additionally, provide playbooks to teardown all of the components after the CTF has been completed.

Documentation Guide
===================

As we build v.1 of the project documentation under the project root is encouraged to be written in markdown. After initial product is achieved additional or improved documentation in other forms will be considered.

Markdown
--------

Use the same markdown header styles that are found in the default role README created by `ansible-role init`. Also use inline code and code blocks whenever adding code samples to documentation.

```md
This is a section header
========================

This is a subsection header
---------------------------
```

Ansible
=======

YAML
----

Some of the initial development on this project was done in Visual Studio Code with the Ansible extension installed. However, contributing developers can use any number of linters and YAML tools as roles will get integrated with Travis CI and Ansible syntax will be checked at the code commit phase.

Single new line separations between tasks or major blocks of code in roles or playbooks are highly appreciated but not enforced. Project code reviewers can provide feedback on code organization and cleanliness. 

Task Naming aka Action Lines
----------------------------

As Ansible uses tasks in playbooks, it uses them similarly in roles. I have found that it is easier to trouble shoot task failures when roles are run if you "bread crumb" the name of the role into each action line. When Ansible is printing to screen the current running task in a play, you see what is in the action or name line of a task. Ansible does not by default tell you what task file the running task came from, so adding a bread crumb helps identify where to debug when a task fails.

```yaml
# Example task file with a regular name and a better name. File name is install_splunk.yml

- name: Do something
  file:
    src: /foo
    dst: /bar

- name: install_splunk - Do something
  file:
    src: /foo
    dst: /bar
```

Role Structure
--------------

The roles already framed in the project were initialized from the Ansible 2.9 role init command. The only paticular practice recommended is how to use the main file of `roles/<role_name>/tasks/`. For our project it is preferred that the only code that lives in main, is `include:` statements that point to other tasks files in the same directory. The includes should utilize tags that are named after the corresponding task file.


```yml
# Example tasks/main.yml

- include: foo.yml
  tags: foo

- include: bar.yml
  tags: bar

- include: baz.yml
  tags: baz
```

These includes would not only tell the role to load these tasks at runtime but also control the run order of segments of code. The tags allow testers to target single tasks or pieces of code from the command line to save development cycles.

Example: `ansible-playbook role.init_aws_env.yml --tags 'foo,baz'` would run the launch init_aws_env role playbook but isolate the run to the tasks with the foo and baz tags.

Variable Naming
---------------

Most variables for this project can be flattened. Avoid using extrenous list or dictionary vars unless it makes sense to.

Variables should be prefixed with a name that points to the role it is from EG...

```yaml
# Example vars file. Vars should be defined in role/defaults/main.yml at a minimum.

init_aws_env_foo_var: <value>
init_splunk_core_bar_var: <value>
```

Variables should also use underscores to breakup the variable name.

Splunk
======

The initial project architecture will utilize an all in one Splunk server. This means a large compute resource is needed to run the actual CTF but small instances can be used for testing or home use. Install and setup guides for Splunk are linked below. The project will be installing Splunk on a CentOS 7 image.
